                        Software development is my passion. Since a young age I have been writing code. It started in
                        middle school for me with the Arduino and progressed from there. Today, I consider myself a
                        self-taught full-stack web developer. Most of my experience lies in Java Web Apps that make use
                        of theJAX-RSFramework through Jersey, making use of libraries like jTwig and Hibernate ORM. I
                        also have some experience in Python writing automation scripts and small apps. While I am
                        comfortable doing work on the front-end, I much prefer the back-end; where the real magic lies.

                    <p>
                        I have a fair bit of Ops experience, stemming not only from my employment with Amazon Web
                        Services, but also in the work I have done for <a href="https://whitestar.systems">WhiteStarSystems</a>.
                        I have used tools like TeamCity and the AWS CLI to manage the Deployment Pipeline,having
                        multiple projects that have a complete CI/CD Pipeline.

                        I graduated from San Diego State University with my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science in
                        May 2018. While at San Diego State, I was a member of the Weber Honors College where I pursued a
                        minor in Interdisciplinary Studies. As a member of the Honors College, I worked not only with
                        students in my discipline, but a diverse group of students on a wide array of projects outside
                        of my major.

                        I have also studied abroad, at the University of Jyväskylä; in Jyväskylä, Finland. While there,I
                        studied Human Sciences, with students from over 20 countries. While my studies there were not
                        strictly major related, they still contributed to the diverse and wholesome education that I
                        have received at both San Diego State University and the University of Jyväskylä.

                        During the Summer of 2017, I had the opportunity to work for Amazon Web Services as a Software
                        Development Engineering Intern where I brought my Web App experience to the Elastic Beanstalk
                        Team. As a result of my work during my internship, I was invited to come back after graduation
                        as a Full-Time Software Development Engineer in their Seattle offices.

                        Learning Management System (in this case Blackboard), but also all the technology found in the
                        classrooms. Outside of my day-to-day operations responsibilities, I also worked as a Full Stack
                        Developer, developing a handful of web-based tools to facilitate Faculty Support and improve our

                        I have also spent time in Student Affairs, working together with Residential Education at San
                        Diego State University in the First-Year residence halls as an Senior Academic Mentor. As an
                        Academic Mentor, commonly abbreviated AM, I lived together with ~35 students and provided
                        academic guidance and support to the students in the 20+ Residential Learning Communities.

                        is:“Is College Worth It?” While I can’t say if college is worth it, I can share my experiences
                        frommy first year as a Computer Science Student at San Diego State, a large public state
                        university.From why I chose San Diego State, to the horrors that are graduation requirements, to
                        theawesome opportunity I had to travel to Finland, and study at the University of Jyväskylä
                        thispast summer. College is both just like I thought it would be, but also very different.</p>
