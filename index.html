                        Software development is my passion. Ever since a young age, I have been writing code from simple science fair projects making use of the Arduino Platform, to production code that serves requests from thousands of customers from across the globe daily. Most of my expertise lies in Java and Python, but I have some experience in Front End development, although I would not consider it my strong suit. Across all of the work I have done, all of it has been focused on improving the customer experience, either by developing new solutions for old problems, or optimizing existing processes in order to bring delight to customers.

                        I have a fair bit of Ops experience, stemming not only from my employment with Amazon Web
                        Services, but also in the work I have done for <a href="https://whitestar.systems">WhiteStarSystems</a>.
                        I have used tools like TeamCity and the AWS CLI to manage the Deployment Pipeline, having
                        multiple projects that have a complete CI/CD Pipeline.

                        I graduated from San Diego State University with my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science in
                        May 2018. While at San Diego State, I was a member of the Weber Honors College where I pursued a
                        minor in Interdisciplinary Studies. As a member of the Honors College, I worked not only with
                        students in my discipline, but a diverse group of students on a wide array of projects outside
                        of my major.

                        I have also studied abroad, at the University of Jyväskylä; in Jyväskylä, Finland. While there, I
                        studied Human Sciences, with students from over 20 countries. While my studies there were not
                        strictly major related, they still contributed to the diverse and wholesome education that I
                        have received at both San Diego State University and the University of Jyväskylä.

                        Currently, I am a Software Development Engineer with Amazon Web Services working as part of the EC2 Windows Enterprise Foundations team, working a new product to improve how customers use AWS and EC2. I originally joined Amazon as a memeber of the Elastic Beanstalk team, which helps to customers deploy their web applications written in a number of supprted languages, including Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, to cusotmer-owned AWS Resources. I rejoined Amazon in July 2018, after interning with the Elastic Beanstalk team during the Summer of 2017, where I developed a beta version of a new internal console to be used by the team.

                        Learning Management System (in this case Blackboard), but also all the technology found in the
                        classrooms. Outside of my day-to-day operations responsibilities, I also worked as a Full Stack
                        Developer, developing a handful of web-based tools to facilitate Faculty Support and improve our

                        I have also spent time in Student Affairs, working together with Residential Education at San

                        Academic Mentor, commonly abbreviated AM, I lived together with ~35 students and provided
                        academic guidance and support to the students in the 20+ Residential Learning Communities.

                        is: “Is College Worth It?” While I can’t say if college is worth it, I can share my experiences
                        from my first year as a Computer Science Student at San Diego State, a large public state
                        university.From why I chose San Diego State, to the horrors that are graduation requirements, to
                        the awesome opportunity I had to travel to Finland, and study at the University of Jyväskylä
                        this past summer. College is both just like I thought it would be, but also very different.</p>
